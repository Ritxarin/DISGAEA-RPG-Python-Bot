## Auto login

1. go to <https://p-public.service.boltrend.com/oauthOs?appid=287&lang=en>
2. open developer tools -> network (ensure persist logs is on)
3. login via webpage
4. inspect the first requests payload, it should look something like:

   ```json
   {
     "appId": "287",
     "account": "<string>",
     "password": "<string>",
     "channel": 3,
     "captchaId": "",
     "validate": "",
     "sourceId": "",
     "sign": "<string>"
   }
   ```

5. Using the variables above set the following environmental variables:
   ```shell
   export STEAM_LOGIN='true'
   export DRPG_EMAIL="<account value>"
   export DRPG_PASS="<password value>"
   export DRPG_SIGN="<sign value>"
   ```
6. be sure to set your device to 3
   ```python
   a = API()
   a.o.wait = 0
   a.o.set_region(2)
   a.o.set_device(3)
   a.quick_login()
   ```

### Set envs using python

If you dont know how to set envs or are on window or w/e use this at the start of your bot script:

```python
import os

os.environ["STEAM_LOGIN"] = 'true'
os.environ["DRPG_EMAIL"] = "<account value>"
os.environ["DRPG_PASS"] = "<password value>"
os.environ["DRPG_SIGN"] = "<sign value>"

from main import API

a = API()
a.o.wait = 0
a.o.set_region(2)
a.o.set_device(3)
a.quick_login()
```

## Using the bot for JP

1. Create an account for JP (preferrably on DMM)
2. Get a transfer code
3. Set region to 1
4. Use jp_reroll_example.py Call the dologin method with the user id and one time code from the transfer. Paste the code in line 18.

```python
   code = 'TRANSFER CODE GOES HERE THE FIRST TIME YOU USE THE BOT'
```

5. The bot generates a new transfer code every time. It will be stored in transfercode.txt
6. After a few uses, you will run into the following error:

   ```json
      server returned error: undefined method `correct_signature?' for nil:NilClass for battle_status
   ```

When you do, open DRPG JP on a different device and use the transfer code there. You do not need to log in afterwards, once you've used the code you can use the bot once again.

7. If you want to reroll, copy the new transfer code into transfercode.txt
